## Problem Statement

**AI-based Application for Auto-Measurement of Land Area**

Traditional land measurement relies on manual surveys—often **inaccurate**, **time-consuming**, and **non-transparent**.  
**GeoSense** automates this process through a dual-layer approach:

* **AI segmentation of satellite imagery** to measure and map land parcels precisely.  
* **Blockchain integration** for transparent, tamper-proof ownership, trade, and governance of geospatial assets.

**Sector:** Land Administration & Revenue  
**Technology Stack:** React, Vite, React-Leaflet, TailwindCSS, Flask, Python, Solidity, Hardhat, Ethereum

## Core Features

### Geospatial Intelligence (AI Module)

- **Auto Land Measurement:** Select an area and let AI calculate its precise area automatically.  
- **Satellite Image Segmentation:** Utilizes the *HQ-SAM (Segment Anything Model – High Quality)* framework for high-accuracy segmentation.  
- **Fine-Tuning on Custom Dataset:** HQ-SAM has been **fine-tuned** using a curated dataset of **satellite images and ground-truth land parcel masks**, significantly improving segmentation accuracy on real-world Indian geospatial data.  
- **Interactive Map Editing:** Draw, edit, and manage polygons directly on the map.  
- **Real-Time Visualization:** Overlay segmented parcels on the live map interface.  
- **Export & Insights:** Export shapefiles, GeoJSONs, and area reports for further analysis.

### Blockchain Layer (Web3 Module)

- **GeoToken (ERC-20):** Native token for payments, rewards, and governance.  
- **GeoNFT (ERC-721):** Represents tokenized land parcels with unique coordinates.  
- **UserRegistry:** Smart contract–based user identity and trust system.  
- **Escrow & Auction Contracts:** Enable secure, automated land trading and auctions.  
- **GeoDAO:** Token-based governance for decisions and dispute resolutions.

## How It Works

1. **Bounding Box Selection:** The user draws a bounding box to mark the target area.  
2. **AI Processing:** The backend fetches the satellite image, runs it through **fine-tuned HQ-SAM**, and generates **segmented land parcels**.  
3. **Blockchain Integration:** Each land parcel can be tokenized into a **GeoNFT**, traded via **escrow or auction**, and managed through **GeoDAO**.  
4. **Unified Visualization:** All AI and blockchain outputs are rendered together on an **interactive React-Leaflet** interface.
